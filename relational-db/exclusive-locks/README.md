When you book your tickets with an airline you are required to complete the payment and confirm your reservation. Once the reservation is complete then you can either optionally do a web check-in and confirm your seats or just before your departure do a physical check-in at the airport.

In this problem statement, let's design this web-check in system, where the passenger logs in to the system with the PNR, performs the seat selection and the gets the boarding pass. If the passenger tries to book a seat, already booked and assigned to the other passenger show an error message requesting passenger to re-select the seats.
